<br>

Sara Lana is a 33 year-old Brazilian artist and developer. She was born in Belo Horizonte (Brazil), studied Mathematics and Electric Engineering in the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Her projects lie in the convergence of art and technology. She often uses varied supports, especially sound, electronics and video, having illustration as an existing element throughout her process of creation.
  
Her work seeks to promote technologic disalienation by calling attention to our detachment to the omnipresence of digital machines in our contemporary society. Besides offering insights on the role of the animals which share space with humans, her work also offers and stimulates the search for more balanced relations with them in our current technologic context.
