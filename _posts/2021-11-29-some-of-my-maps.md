Here are some of my projects with maps and architectural plans:

## Orelhinha

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p>
Orelhinha is a sound piece created from calls made to public telephones on the banks of the São Francisco and Jequitinhonha rivers.

The phones were found traveling along the banks of these rivers using maps with panoramic views of public spaces and with satellite images. The number of each phone was retrieved by crossing its coordinates identified on the route with information collected in the database of the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency.

## Run and Look the Sky

<br>
Looking virtually at the sky and guided by tools for panoramic map viewing, I traced a route in a hitherto unknown city. I then traveled to this place to walk trhough the same route in person. During the walk, I recorded the sounds of my footsteps and an eerily familiar environment.

## Blind Spots

**Blind Spots** is a project which aims to create a tool of counter-surveillance. It is divided in two research approaches, Tactics of (In)Visibility:
  <br><br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
      
<b>TACTICS OF VISIBILITY</b>
<br><br>
A helmet able to automatically detect surveillance cameras  was created. It indicates to its users when they are being filmed. This device reveals and enhances cameras which are each time more discreet and camouflaged in the cities.  
  
The device also contains a GPS and when it detects a camera, its coordinates are registered and saved on a map (see below), automatically mapping a given route.
<br><br>
</div>
  <div class="column">
<b>TACTICS OF INVISIBILITY – IN PROCESS</b>
  <br><br>
A route designer is in development which is able to create routes from point A to point B, in a city, walking only by the blind spots of its cameras.
<br><br>

Here [&nbsp;a first prototype&nbsp;](../invisibility-tracer){:target="_blank"} of the invisibility route tracer.

## Species of Spaces I

Species of Spaces is an investigation initialized  in 2019 which is based on images captured on surveillance cameras.
  
The first work of this series presents in videos, architectural blueprints and annotations, intimate diaries of 5 characters built based on domestic images of surveillance cameras with live access on the internet. 
  
The characters act as if they are not being observed and as if they completely trust in the technology at hand, highlighting the naturalized processes of surveillance in our contemporary world. The diaries carry an insight on the dysfunctionalities in a society of hyper-surveillance.

## Sertão Sound Diary

The **Sertão Sound Diary** is a documentary record based on the path and notes of Guimarães Rosa on his trip to the hinterland of Minas Gerais in 1952.

A Boiada (The Herd), title given by the writer to his diary, leaves Fazenda da Sirga (Andrequicé) in the direction of Fazenda São Francisco (Araçaí).

The most diverse sounds leap from the pages and stimulate a synesthesically sharp sense of the senses, listening to the symphony of the cerrado.

## Cartography of Memories

Cartography of Memories is a collaborative sound map that seeks to record and preserve, through oral reports, experiences in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which began in 2020. We want to achieve the greatest number and diversity of reports possible, and thus configure a heterogeneous panorama, which values listening to subjectivities about this worldwide event.

The reports are recorded in audio, with a maximum duration of 5 minutes. Identities are preserved, only the location is required for the report to be properly added to the map. The form and theme are free, spontaneity is therefore valued: the world is experiencing a pandemic, and how do you feel?

The project was created in Brazil by a group of historians, scientists, artists, communicators, developers, educators and disseminators. These professionals met through the Emergency Laboratory – Covid – 19 to work together on solidarity alternatives, especially relevant in the Brazilian context.
