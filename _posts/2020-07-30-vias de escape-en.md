The audible reverberation in objects and closed spaces highlights the mark of sounds already produced inside them, impregnating them with sediments of their material, spatial and temporal presence.
This stain, as well as the murmurs of the city are deadened and diverted on the walls and concrete, which manifest an inherent sound to these places and bodies.
  
To investigate these intrinsic sounds of the city, we dedicated ourselves to create paraphernalias of listening using garbage collected from the streets, deposits and dumps of Valparaíso: an experience of subversion, decomposition and expansion of the perception of the audible surrounding of the city. 
It also aims at inhabiting listening as an active action, to probe its limitations and to propose a set of new intentions: rediscovering (and disrobing) listening and realizing that we hear ourselves hearing and we listen to ourselves listening. All of this lies on the limit of interior-exterior, provoking a change of auditive atitudes, a route of escape.
