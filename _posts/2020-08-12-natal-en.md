In the living room of a house in Tel Aviv, a lady places some ornaments on her table. At the same time, in Bangkok, a family gets together for dinner. In Houston, a man spends the afternoon wrapping presents, and in Coux, France, an endless supper is served for the few. All of these scenes are visible on the Internet, recorded by IP security cameras used by residents to monitor their private spaces. I had access to these images using standard passwords established by the manufacturers of these cameras, which often, due to the negligence of their users, have never been changed and, in general, are very simple: "12345" or ø.

During December 2018 I took advantage of this loophole to observe houses from around the world. Lonely people or whole families gathered to celebrate or spend Christmas day.
